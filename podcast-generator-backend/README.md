I understand you're having trouble with retaining the Markdown formatting for your README.md in VSCode. Let's go over how you can ensure it is correctly formatted to display well both locally and on GitHub.


Key Markdown Elements

Here's a guide to the main Markdown elements you used and how to format them:


Headings:
Use # for headings. For example, # PodcastGen Backend.
Increment # characters for subheadings, like ## for "Description".
Images:
Format inline with Markdown image syntax: ![Alt text](relative/path/to/image.png).
If you need to resize images, that can't be done natively via Markdown on GitHub. Consider resizing externally if needed.
Lists:
Use - or * for unordered lists and 1. for ordered lists.
Ensure there's a new line between lists or headings and following content.
Inline Code and Code Blocks:
Inline code uses backticks: npm install.
Code blocks use triple backticks:
     
 git clone https://github.com/incognito1025/podcast-generator-backend.git
 cd podcast-generator-backend
 
     

Specify the language for syntax highlighting (e.g., `

 `).

5. **Sections and Formatting:**
   - Use horizontal rules `---` or `***` to separate distinct sections.
   - Emphasize text using `*italic*` or `**bold**`.

### Example README.md

Hereâ€™s an example of the beginning of your README with proper Markdown syntax:
